# Testing JavaScript Completely

Testing JavaScript is hard. Not any one thing in partiular, but building an entire testing ecosystem
that plays well with itself and fullfills all the requirements of a modern, robust testing configuration
is an immense undertaking. We have been there. We have trialed and errored. We have backtracked. We have
hit many more dead ends than I care to talk about.

All of that work has led us here.
